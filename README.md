# **EcoHaven - README**

## **Color System**

### **Primary Palette:**

- **Forest Green (#2e7d32):** Symbolizes sustainability, nature, and eco-consciousness.

- **Soft Beige (#f5f5dc):** Used for background to keep a clean and natural look.

- **Earth Brown (#5d4037):** Used in accents and text to give a grounded and organic aesthetic.

### **Rationale:**

The chosen palette reinforces the environmental and minimalist theme of the website. Green promotes eco-friendliness, beige softens the overall appearance to remain inviting and calming, while brown enhances readability and connects to the earthy feel of sustainability.

## **Breakpoint Logic**

### **Mobile (default - < 768px):**

- Single-column layout.

- Hamburger menu for navigation.

- Stacked sections for better scroll-based interaction.

### **Tablet (768px - 1024px):**

- Two-column grid for card sections like Tips and Products.

- Navigation still collapses to hamburger.

- Adjusted font sizes and paddings for better readability on mid-sized screens.

### **Desktop (â‰¥ 1024px):**

- Full navigation menu displayed horizontally.

- Three or four-column layout for content grids (depending on screen width).

- Hero section expands with larger typography and call-to-action button.

## **Creative Divergences from the Mockup**

### **Branding Customization:**

Introduced a custom logo with accompanying tagline, giving the brand a more personal and memorable identity beyond placeholder text.

### **Typography Enhancement:**

Used the Inter font family via Google Fonts to enhance legibility and aesthetics across all devices.

### **Iconography Integration:**

Integrated Font Awesome icons across navigation and content sections to improve visual communication and reduce text redundancy.

### **Lifestyle Section Design:**

Expanded the "Lifestyle" content into distinct cards with conceptual icons, making the section more informative and engaging compared to a flat text approach.

### **Improved Accessibility:**

Semantic HTML structure was emphasized for better screen reader compatibility and improved SEO.

### **Enhanced Interactivity:**

The "Start Your Green Journey" call-to-action button was added in the hero section to guide user engagement flow.
